Hey,

It contains the forms for each BU. Forms are currently in its basic state. It can be designed according to your requirement.

We noticed that the websites are based on WordPress CRM. It's possible that you've used a plugin for creatinng
contact forms. However, the lead forms that we've created need to be implemented manually in the website with the custom code.
What you can do now is clone the contact page and replace the form section with the one we've provided and design it accordingly.
By this, rest of the page will remain unaffected. However, this will not store the contact entries in wordpress. As it is
no longer linked to the plugin and works standalone. But, you can further do some coding to manually enter the contact 
entries in Wordpress DB upon form submission. Totally upto you.
